This PYNQ Overlay contains the below accelerated image processing algorithms.

* rgb2hsv	
* subsample
* equalizehist
* gaussianBlur
* sobel
* canny
* dilation
* erosion

## Peripherals
* OV5640 Camera Board (Waveshare OV5640 or equaivalent)
* PMOD-Camera adapter
* HDMI monitor
## Quick Start

Open a terminal on your PYNQ board and run:

```
sudo pip3 install --upgrade git+https://github.com/xupsh/Pynq-CV-OV5640.git
```

or offline install:

```
sudo pip3 install --upgrade .
```

Currently this repository is compatible with [PYNQ image v2.4](http://www.pynq.io/board), Vivado Design Suite 2018.3.
